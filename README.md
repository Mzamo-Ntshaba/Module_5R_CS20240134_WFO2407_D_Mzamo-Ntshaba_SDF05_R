# Challenges

- the biggest challenge was figuring out how i was going to go about the transitions and figuring out how to scale them correctly cause next thing its something you didnt expect i would say trial and error also helped with the sizing and it ended up working

# Highlights 

- I am particularly proud at how the final buttons looked initially i did not think i was going to get there loved using that letter spacing i learnt from scrimba additionally i love how smooth the transitions are throughout
